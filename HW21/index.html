                        <h2>English Synopsis</h2>
                        <p>
                        The series tells about the life of <i>Ian Adamchevskyi</i>, the head of a Sarmatian noble family in <mark>1670</mark>,
                        when the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was exhausted by the rebellion of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, the war with <sub>Moscow</sub> and the Swedish invasion.<br>
                        The main character is a feudal lord who owns half of the small village of Adamchikha.
                        He dreams of becoming <q>the most famous Jan-Pavel in the history of Poland</q>. <br>
                        He solves <u>problems</u> typical for Polish lords of that time, <strong>how not to pay taxes, keep the peasants in subjection and give his daughter to the richest tycoon</strong>.<br>
                        The series in a humorous way reinterprets the history of ancient Poland from the perspective of the 21st century.
                        The series satirizes the topics of religion, which are quite taboo for modern Polish society
                        and so-called traditional values.
                        </p>
